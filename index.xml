      <description>This is that obligatory hello world post that always comes with any sort of programming adventure. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to reboot this website since the last time anything done with it was high school.
This is also my second attempt at a blog. Eventually, I am going to port over the blog posts from my original wordpress I tried to make last year.</description>

      <description>This is your about me page. Use it to write up a witty and engaging description of yourself.
You can include your hobbies, favorite foods, photos of your ex-lovers, anything you like.
You can even include some ipsums:
