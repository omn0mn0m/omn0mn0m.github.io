I know this is a mostly technical blog, but I just wanted to say that I have taken knitting back up. I recently went home for my girlfriend's birthday, and she wanted to have arts and crafts time with me. I told her that I used to know how to knit, so we went to Jo-Ann's and bought one skein of yarn and 5mm needles.

I'm starting to realise that knitting is a pretty intricate craft if one wants it to be. I have since joined [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/) to better organise my hobby.

So far I have made one little garter stitch swatch. I am hoping to have a small stockinette swatch done by the end of this weekend.
