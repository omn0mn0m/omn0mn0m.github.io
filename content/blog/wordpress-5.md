I looked at some PowerPoints I made in 2014 today from when I was getting really into showing new robotics members how to program... After going back and learning how to program with some guidance from textbooks and websites, I realised that I tried teaching way too fast. I am on exercise 11 of Learn Python the Hard Way, and I am still at printing strings. I definitely need to make some adjustments to those PowerPoints.

On another note, I was finally able to copy and paste (well, kill and yank) in Emacs. I had to do M-x set-mark-command instead of C-SPC. I'm not too happy about this, but I mean hopefully Microsoft fixes that issue one day.
