Honestly, I was sleeping just fine until a dream woke me up. In this dream, I was going my merry way, until all of a sudden I had to write a robot in Java. Those of you that read [my first blog post]({{< relref "wordpress-1.md" >}}) will know that I started really programming in FRC and I used Java for that. I took this as a sign to revisit Java a bit. That was a bad call on my part.

I turned on my phone from my bedside and begun to research how to compile larger Java projects and found very little information as to how to program Java without an IDE. I found some tools like Maven and Ant, but that was about it. In fact, the only thing that I did find was [this blog post by Oracle](https://blogs.oracle.com/bloggerkedar/entry/java_development_without_an_ide) advising against not using an IDE. Wow.

Thus, I did what any sane person would do: I decided to shove the idea into a box and open it another day. For now, I will be content just working through problems in [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/). I never actually had the time to finish all the exercises before I had to start programming robots.
