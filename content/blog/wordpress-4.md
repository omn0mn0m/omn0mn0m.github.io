After two midterm exams, I am back in the swing of things and learning more. After Codecademy reset my Python progress to make way for their new curriculum, I switched over to learning through [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/). As I already know a lot of Python, I am simply going over these guides as a way to further my understanding in any way possible, as well as get acclimated to using Emacs, which is my text editor of choice for this adventure.

As I started using Emacs more and more, I realised just how much I need to practice with Emacs before I could really get down to being productive in it. Because of this, I may have to spend a day just playing around in Emacs and trying to get things working. For now though, I am learning by doing as I work through Learn Python the Hard Way.

I have also decided that my ultimate goal by the end of all this is to work through a Lisp textbook or two and be able to replicate the generic program that I have yet to decide.
