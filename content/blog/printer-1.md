**UPDATE: I have sold my Anet A8, so I checked off everything that I did to it below and will not be upgrading it further. We'll see what 3D printer my future holds.**

Following the lead of some of my friends at college, I bought an Anet A8. For those of you who are not familiar with the Anet A8, it is a 3D printer kit that costs approximately $150. How does it get this cheap? By being an okay printer that requires hours of work to be functional.

Over my fall break, I built the printer over the course of 24 hours with many breaks in between. There were various issues, such as mounting things upside-down and pieces requiring hammering to fit into place. All struggles aside, I finished and had a working printer.

This is my printer in the middle of one of its first prints:

Something I can appreciate about the printer is the amount of flexibility and control over the design. [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/anet-a8-prusa-i3/things) has countless prints available to improve the printer.

These are most of the things on my to-do list for the printer:

* \[x\] Add a MOSFET to the hotbed
* \[x\] Print top T-braces for X-axis stability
* \[x\] Print bottom T-braces for X-axis stability
* \[x\] Print adapters to make the spool holder better
* \[x\] Print a better fan duct
* \[x\] Add a power switch for the printer with a fuse
* \[x\] Print knobs to adjust bed level instead of the wing nuts
* \[x\] Drill out the threads for the bed to allow for easier bed leveling
* \[ \] Flash better firmware onto the control board
* \[ \] Print belt tensioners
* \[x\] Get better bearings or find a better lubricant
* \[x\] Print an extruder button to make filament switching feel better

When you are buying the Anet A8, you are not buying it to have a 3D printer necessarily. You are buying a project to work on and learn from.
