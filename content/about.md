I am a recent undergraduate with a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering from The George Washington University. Some of my areas of interest include embedded control systems, digital design, video game designs, and medicine. Currently, I am trying to figure out my life.

Some of my past experiences including being the co-president and control systems lead for my university's [robotics team](https://gw-robotics.github.io/), acting as the "guardian angel" for my university's rocket team's payload group, and mentoring [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) teams in the DMV area.

Outside of engineering, I have volunteered as an emergency medical technician in Pennsylvania, and still hold an active license. I have also spent 40 hours at GWU Hospital as a student emergency room technician.
