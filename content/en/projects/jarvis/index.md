## Past Attempts
This project first started at a PennApps hackathon in late 2013 where the code was written in basically two hours with minimal functionality.

After that, I revisited it in summer 2014 until spring 2015 for my high school graduation project. This time the emphasise was on conversationalism and the ability to answer messages on Facebook. It also was able to search Wolfram Alpha for answers to questions if it could recognise a question was being asked.
