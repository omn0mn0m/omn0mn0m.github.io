In four days, I will be deleting my Facebook as part of my year-long journey in taking back what little digital privacy I still can. As with all privacy and security related topics for my New Year's resolution, there has to be a blog post about it so that people can follow along on their own journey.

# Why Leave Facebook
It took a bit of thinking about, but in the end I decided that there was really no reason for me to keep Facebook anymore. Most of my friends that I regularly speak with do so through text or Discord (even though Discord has its host of privacy issues). The only thing Facebook really offered me was a way to see what people I knew from high school or college were up to nowadays. Even then, it did a poor job of it, and I just ended up connected with most people on LinkedIn anyways.
