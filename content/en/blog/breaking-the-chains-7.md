# Some Personal Stories

Let me start this post off with an example of trying to navigate without Google Maps. I had just downloaded OSMand, a free and open-source navigation app, and was super pumped to try it. I also was planning on driving to my girlfriend's college to visit that weekend, so I thought it would be perfect opportunity. The drive takes about an hour, and goes straight down the highway for most of it. While I knew the way to get there, I allowed myself to throw caution to the wind and followed every instruction OSMand threw at me. Little did I know, it had figured that the best way to get to her school was paying a toll and getting on the PA Turnpike. To get onto the turnpike, it made me take a few interesting turns down some random roads I had never used before. Yet, it still managed to get me to my destination, so I chalked it up as a win. I have since turned off toll roads unless I absolutely knew I should use one.

Now, let me share an example of a time where OSMand was not so great as getting me to my final destination. This time, I am going to a laser tag place for a friend's birthday (fun fact, we had been there previously after junior prom, I just didn't realise it). The plan was to meet my friends there, since I was helping my mum buy a car at a dealership prior to the birthday event, so my friend sent me the address to the location but not the name of the place.

# Why Not to Use Google Maps
