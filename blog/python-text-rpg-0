When I first taught myself how to program, the first project suggested to me was to make a text-based RPG from scratch (no third-party libraries). At the time, I was learning Java so I could program my school's FRC robot so naturally the RPG was written in Java. The goal of this blog mini-series is to make yet another text-based RPG, but now in Python.

## Setting Up GitHub
The first step to take (and one I didn't know back then) is to set up version control for your project. So [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) and make a [new repository](https://github.com/new). I'm naming the repo "Dungeon-Crawler-2". Leave it public since that's free.

Feel free to initialise the repo with a README, .gitignore, and LICENSE. I am choosing "Python" for the .gitignore and "GNU General Public License v3.0" for the license.

Next, you'll want to clone your repository. This just means downloading a local copy that you can upload back to GitHub with your new changes later. Because we aren't scrubs, we'll be downloading the [command-line tool](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once it is installed, type the following `git clone https://github.com/<TYPE YOUR USErNAME HERE>/<TYPE YOUR REPO NAME HERE>.git`

Don't copy and paste the above command, type it out and fill in the areas where it tells you to type stuff.

You should now have a directory on your computer named the same as your GitHub repo name.
