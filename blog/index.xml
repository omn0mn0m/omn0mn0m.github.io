      <description>This is that obligatory hello world post that always comes with any sort of programming adventure. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to reboot this website since the last time anything done with it was high school.
This is also my second attempt at a blog. Eventually, I am going to port over the blog posts from my original wordpress I tried to make last year.</description>

      <description>EDIT: This blog post comes unedited from my (now nonexistent) Wordpress blog. Pictures have not been included, however.
I have begun to write code in Emacs, and compile from a command line. As this is my first blog entry, I should explain why I chose such a masochistic path. I only ever took one technology course ever. It was &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Computer Science&amp;rdquo; and was taken purely to fulfill a high school graduation requirement.</description>
