<p>&ldquo;Just because you&rsquo;re paranoid doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Joseph Heller, <em>Catch-22</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My New Year&rsquo;s resolution for 2020 is to break the chains that have been cast upon us by tech companies. This means switching from closed, proprietary software to free and open-source software (FOSS) when possible. It also means being more mindful of who has my personal data, as well as being in as much control over my information as I can be.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like many of my friends, by now you&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to care about all this if you have nothing to hide.&rdquo; While it may be true that I have nothing to hide, that doesn&rsquo;t change that fact that I should have the ability to. I would write a whole essay about why wanting privacy shouldn&rsquo;t automatically imply that I&rsquo;m partaking in deplorable activities and why it&rsquo;s okay to want my privacy respected, but this TED talk already explains <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters">why privacy matters</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now January 2020, 5 years after that TED talk and 6 years after the Edward Snowden leaks. Didn&rsquo;t we already solve the whole privacy issue by now? The fact of the matter is that we haven&rsquo;t. We still live in a tech-driven world with laws that haven&rsquo;t caught up yet, and it&rsquo;s honestly scary how much free reign this gives companies. If Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ValJMOpt7s">congressional hearing</a> is any indicator, US lawmakers are nowhere near tech-literate enough to update our laws to protect citizens from being exploited by companies.</p>
<p>Our data has become a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-much-can-facebook-potentially-make-selling-your-data/">major money maker</a> for companies, and we aren&rsquo;t even getting paid for it. Software companies are constantly testing how little ownership over software we will allow, strong-arming lawmakers to create laws to help them <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/09/first-sale-doctrine/">take away our rights to the software we purchase</a>. We don&rsquo;t truly own the software we use, and in many cases, don&rsquo;t have the option to even know what that software is fully doing. With how dependent we have on our online accounts and technology, it&rsquo;s shocking that not more people care that their <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-account-banned-1054640/">entire Google account can be terminated</a> for <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/09/google-account-bans-youtube-emote-spam-markiplier/">spamming emojis on a live feed</a>. Imagine waking up one day and losing everything on your Google Drive for interacting with a streamer on YouTube. We have to do something.</p>
<p>People have been taking actions to protect their digital rights for decades now. Recent movements, like the Degoogle movement, are just some of the latest to have sprung up. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Freedom Foundation (EFF)</a> has been defending our digital rights and privacy since 1990. And before them, the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> worked to promote our freedom to own our software and use it as we please since 1985.</p>
<p>While I may not be starting an entire movement or anything, I can at least do my part by being one less electronic consumer to exploit. Every week, I will be writing about an aspect of my technological life that I have changed to put tech companies in check and to take back control of my data, whether I made the change four days ago or four years ago.</p>
<p>My plan is to ultimately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move away from proprietary software wherever possible, opting instead for free and open-source software so that I am not at the mercy of tech companies doing what they please with the software I use</li>
<li>Reevaluate how privacy-respecting the technology I use is (messaging apps, email services, web browsers, etc), and make changes as needed</li>
<li>Delete most of my social media and online service accounts, keeping as few as possible to keep in touch with people and function in the 21st century</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this because you are just as tired as I am of tech companies owning our lives, I highly encourage you go through this journey with me.</p>
