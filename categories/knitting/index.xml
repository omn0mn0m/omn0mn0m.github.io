      <description>I know this is a mostly technical blog, but I just wanted to say that I have taken knitting back up. I recently went home for my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday, and she wanted to have arts and crafts time with me. I told her that I used to know how to knit, so we went to Jo-Ann&amp;rsquo;s and bought one skein of yarn and 5mm needles.
I&amp;rsquo;m starting to realise that knitting is a pretty intricate craft if one wants it to be.</description>
